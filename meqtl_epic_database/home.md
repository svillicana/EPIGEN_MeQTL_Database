## Welcome to the MeQTL EPIC Database

&nbsp;

Multiple studies have shown that genetic effects can have strong impacts on DNA methylation levels. [Methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02347-6) are genetic loci at which genetic variation is associated with variation in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site.

The **MeQTL EPIC Database** reports the results of a meQTL analysis at 724,499 CpGs profiled with the Illumina Infinium MethylationEPIC array in 2,358 blood samples from three UK cohorts. You can find the full details of the study in:
