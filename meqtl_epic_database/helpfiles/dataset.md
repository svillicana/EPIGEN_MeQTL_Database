#### Datasets

- **Top meQTLs**: most significant meQTL association (in both *cis* and *trans*) for each CpG at a significance level of FDR < 0.05.

- **Clumped meQTLs**: meQTL associations for each CpG at a significance level of FDR < 0.05, after linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based clumping of the SNPs.
