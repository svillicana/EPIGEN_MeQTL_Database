## Welcome to the EPIGEN MeQTL Database

&nbsp;

Multiple studies have shown that genetic effects can have strong impacts on DNA methylation levels. [Methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs)](https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-021-02347-6) are genetic loci at which genetic variation is associated with variation in DNA methylation at a specific CpG site.

The **EPIGEN MeQTL Database** compiles results from multiple meQTL studies conducted by the Epigenomics Research Group at the Department of Twin Research at King's College London, under the leadership of [Dr Jordana Bell](mailto:jordana.bell@kcl.ac.uk). Details of the available databases are outlined below.

You can explore the CpGs and meQTL SNPs in their genomic context in the **Visualisation tab**.
