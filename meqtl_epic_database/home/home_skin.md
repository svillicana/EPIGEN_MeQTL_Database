The **Skin DB** reports the results of meQTL analysis in whole-skin tissue samples from up to 394 twins, profiled using the Infinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip ([Shore et al.](), under review).

The table displays the conditionally independent CpG-meQTL associations identified using the `cojo --slct` method. You can download the complete *cis* results at a FDR 5% level at the bottom of the tab.
